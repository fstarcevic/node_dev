// Async programing is the basic for event programing in JS. JS is handlong code sequentialy and when run it gos t ill end and closes. So there are no threads aservices or something
// what can handle events or async behaviour. For that purpose there is event handler or EVENT LOOP so called in JS which is actualy hande the events or async events. Functions or methods 
// actualy registers the so salled call back function s(functions to be called later or back when some event heppen) and thos efunctions are registered at EVENT LOOP with reference to event, and
// this is the part of V8 engine or Google JS interpreter, or SpiderMonkey Firefox JS interpreter.
